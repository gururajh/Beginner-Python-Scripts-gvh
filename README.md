### Advanced Python Password Generator - Full Feature Prompt

I want to create an **advanced Python password generator** script starting from a simple CLI that evolves into a fully fledged user-friendly GUI app. The requirements are:

1. Base functionality:
   - Generate a random password of user-specified length.
   - Allow toggling inclusion of digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols.
   - If no character types are selected, raise an error.
   - Use Python’s `random` and `string` modules for character choices.

2. Enhancements:
   - Save generated passwords to a secure local file (`saved_passwords.txt`) upon user request.
   - Include a complexity indicator which rates the password as `"Very Weak"`, `"Weak"`, `"Moderate"`, `"Strong"`, or `"Very Strong"` based on length and character diversity.
   - Provide a full mnemonic memory hint for the entire password where each character is represented by:
        - Digits as words (e.g. `1` → `"One"`)
        - Uppercase letters as NATO phonetic alphabet words (e.g. `A` → `"Alpha"`)
        - Lowercase letters as lowercase versions of NATO phonetics
        - Symbols as descriptive names (e.g. `@` → `"At"`, `$` → `"Dollar"`)
   - Guarantee at least one character from each selected type is included in the password.
   - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter with:
        - Entry box for password length (default 12)
        - Checkboxes for selecting digits, uppercase, lowercase, symbols
        - A "Generate Password" button
        - A multi-line text widget showing the generated password, mnemonic hint, and strength
        - A "Save Password" button that is disabled until a password is generated
        - A label displaying the password strength rating

3. Code quality and fixes:
   - No syntax errors: fix indentation, remove stray characters.
   - Include helpful debug print statements visible in terminal (useful for VSCode users) for key events: app start, password generation, save success/failure.
   - Well-documented functions and classes with clear docstrings and inline comments.
   - When saving passwords, append to the file instead of overwriting previous data.

4. Expected user experience:
   - Running the script opens the GUI window.
   - User chooses preferences and generates a password instantly.
   - Password with mnemonic hint and strength rating display immediately.
   - User can save the password to a file using the GUI button.
   - The application shows clear messages on success or errors.

5. GitHub Wiki documentation (short):
   - Summarize the enhancements in 5 bullet points:
     - Save Passwords to a File
     - Complexity Indicator for password strength
     - User Interface with Tkinter GUI
     - Full mnemonic memory hint for entire password
     - Guarantee character diversity from all selected types

Deliver the complete Python script file with all these features implemented. The solution should be compatible with Python 3.x and run seamlessly on Windows with Tkinter installed.
